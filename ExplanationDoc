//Include "a document explaining your current research strategies, how these improved over the semester,
//and some future ideas for improving them further."

A majority of my research has been primarily based off the games I'm loosely basing mine on.
I've been drawing a lot of inspiration from Animal Crossing, like the way the dialogue is important to the game functions
and how object interactivity heavily influences the other characters/animals. I started by just trying to search how to code similar
functions into Unity, but then realized later on that a better strategy would be to make lists of ideas.
I started with goals that I thought would be reasonable to accomplish. These mainly included functions the game HAS to have, and are the
bare requirements for my game to function the way I would like it to. I then made a separate things I would like my game to have, but weren't 
as high of a priority to get done. I then made a short list of things I could add once I (hypothetically) finished all of my other tasks.
This way, I can take it step-by-step in the future, and not get too overhelmed with trying to do too many things at once.
For next semester, to improve my time management (since it was the biggest thing I struggled with this semester), my optimistic goal to 
improve my strategy is to try to get at least one thing on my list done every week-two weeks, depending on the size of the task. I'm hoping
that by setting this expectaton for myself that I'll be able to give myself more time to do the less critical, more fun frilly things I would
like to add on later in the process.
